Benchmarks for Dash taken from the D newsgroups
-----------------------------------------------

This repository contains benchmarks that have been discussed
on the D newsgroup, typically because somebody has found an
example of performance issues with D and blogged about it or
posted it on Reddit.

The goal is not to collect the best fine-tuned implementations
that people have been able to come up with over the course of
the NG discussion, but to put together samples of code that
people who are interested in performance, but not overly
familiar with the implementation details of D would expect to
be fast.
